# Data Structures

In this application I compare and contrast four data structures by reading data into them from the same external file.

## Array
An array can store multiple values of the same type and can contain a fixed amount of elements.

## Hash Map (Hash Table)
A hash map or a hash table is considered more efficient than other table lookup structures. It uses a hash key to find where corresponding values are stored in the table.

## Stack
A stack stores items in the order of last in, first out (LIFO). The operations are fast and all take O(1) time. They can be implemented with a linked list or a dynamic array.

## Queue
A queue stores items in the order of first in, first out (FIFO). The operations are fast and all take O(1) time. They are most easily implemented with a linked list.
