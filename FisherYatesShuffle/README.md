## What is this project?
This is a project created for a Fall 2020 Algorithms class at Columbia College Chicago. This solution is written to demonstrate an example of the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm using in the form of a C# console application.

## What is a Fisher-Yates shuffle?
An unbiased permutation algorithm which generates a random permutatiuon (or shuffle) of a finite sequence. You can read more about it [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle);
