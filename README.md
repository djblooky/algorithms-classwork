# Algorithms Portfolio

Welcome to my Algorithms portfolio! In this repository, I demonstrate my knowledge of basic algorithms and their practical uses.

## Assignment 1: Big-O Notation
I learned how to write and interpret Big-O notation and how to consider Constant, Linear, and Quadratic run-times in my code.

## Assignment 2: Fisher-Yates Shuffle
I researched the history of the Fisher-Yates Shuffle and wrote my own example using the algorithm.

## Assignment 3: Data Structures
TBD
